# parabolae
I know applets are pretty much obsolete, but this is the only way I knew how to create graphics components in Java. I drew 4 lines that intersect to form the base asterisk shape. I added points at 10 pixel intervals to each line to help me position the diagonals that would make up the parabolas. When you click the button, a section of one quadrant is filled up with the "parabola."
