# parabolae
I used graphics components to draw parabolic curves with straight lines. First, there are 4 lines that intersect to form the base asterisk shape, with points at 10 pixel intervals to each line to help position the diagonals that would make up the parabolas. When you click the button, a section of one quadrant is filled up with the "parabola."
